						<p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;margin-top: 30px;">Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic cause of kidney failure worldwide. This inherited disorder leads to the formation of cysts in the kidneys, causing them to enlarge and lose function. ADPKD also can affect other organs like liver, pancreas, spleen, heart, and brain etc. Approximately, 3-5 % of patients with chronic kidney disease in India have ADPKD. There is need of developing and implementing interventions which could delay progression of kidney disease in patients with ADPKD. The PKD-India Network is an initiative to establish clinical care and research framework for patients with ADPKD in India. A number of academic and research institutes in India have come together to establish this platform. Its first initiative of a clinical trial investigating the use of metformin for delaying progression of kidney disease in ADPKD has been funded by Indian Council of Medical Research.</p>
